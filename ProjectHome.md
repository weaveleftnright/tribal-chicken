Create customized live filesystems from existing live operating systems such as Backtrack (BT5) and Kali Linux (BT6). An easy way to surpass the space limitations of the 4GB live filesystem structure and generate your own unique Linux distributions on the fly.

Tribal Chicken was designed for BT5 and Kali, but can be easily adapted to other live filesystems a short amount of time.
